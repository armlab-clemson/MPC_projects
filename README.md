Ongoing MPC exercises/projects
-------------------------------

Folder: MPC_exercise
====================

A control exercise for point-point trajectory control of a simple car using MPC. Used this as an exercise to familiarize myself with the tuning practices, simulation practices, MPC development structure, etc.

If you want to recreate my steps please first go through the presentation file named 'explainations_ppt'. Once you go through it, you can open the file 'mpc_car_master' to run all the different simulations mentioned in the ppt.

I separated out the code files just for seeing the difference in code more easily (side by side).

Folder: MPC_segwaybot
=====================

Code: Currently in development phase. Coming soon.

A current research paper im working on. The goal is to provide stability whilst performing tasks for a self-balancing mobile manipulator which are not passively stable. To see the premise of the project please read the ile 'proposal.docx'. For the hardware implementation i'm building a prototype that integrates what I call a 'segwaybot' which is basically a self balancing robot and the ROBOTIS 'OpenManipulator'. Pictures of these robots are available in the folder. The segwaybot was built by me while the OpenManipulator is a kit sold by Robotis.
